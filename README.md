# Possession

This is my game design document that is still being updated as time goes on: 
[Game Design Document.docx](https://github.com/NfagieYansaneh/Possession/files/6584815/Game.Design.Document.docx)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Gamepad controls are a bit wonky right now since I having implemented true 8-directional movement and haven't incorporated in deadzones yet. So it is advised to use keyboard controls for now

* WASD / D-pad / Joystick - move
* H / West button (Controller) - Light attack (No visual feedback yet)
* J / North button (Controller) - Heavy attack (No visual feedback yet)
* U / East button (Controller) - Throw possession crown (Uses ur movement keys to know where you are throwing)
* K / Right trigger (Controller) - Basic ability (No visual feedback yet)
* L / Left trigger (Controller) - Ultimate ability (No visual feedback yet)

* Shift / Left or Right bumpers (Controller) - Dodge (Uses ur movement keys to know where you are dodging. Furthermore, stand still while dodging to do a neutral dodge)

* Space - Jump (You can double jump)
