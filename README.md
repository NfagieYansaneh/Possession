# Possession

Game design document (Do be aware that my game does not need to follow exactly my game design document as changes will and have sorta happened already. I am down to listen for any feedback or advice you guys have since I need feedback to pass my highschool programming assignment):

[Game Design Document.docx](https://github.com/NfagieYansaneh/Possession/files/6732061/Game.Design.Document.docx)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Game pad controls are sort of disabled for a bit, so a mouse is required to activate the light and heavy attacks just for the time being

* WASD / D-pad / Joystick - move
* Left Click / H / West button (Controller) - Light attack (No visual feedback yet)
* Right Click / J / North button (Controller) - Heavy attack (No visual feedback yet)
* U / East button (Controller) - Throw possession crown (Uses ur movement keys to know where you are throwing)
* K / Right trigger (Controller) - Basic ability (No visual feedback yet)
* L / Left trigger (Controller) - Ultimate ability (No visual feedback yet)

* Shift / Left or Right bumpers (Controller) - Dodge (Uses ur movement keys to know where you are dodging. Furthermore, stand still while dodging to do a neutral dodge)

* Space - Jump (You can double jump)

The controls are bound to change. No way am I letting "U" be the possess key while I could just use middle click.
